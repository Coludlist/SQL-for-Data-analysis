# SQL-for-Data-analysis
This repository contains the solution for Task 4 of the Elevate Labs Data Analyst Internship. The objective of this task was to use SQL queries to extract, manipulate, and analyze structured data from an e-commerce database.

Tools Used
Database: MySQL

IDE: MySQL Workbench

Project Steps
Database Creation: Established a new database (schema) named Ecommerce_SQL_Database in MySQL Workbench.

Table Creation: Defined and created four tables to model a simple e-commerce system:

Customers: Stores customer information.

Products: Stores product details and prices.

Orders: Stores order-level information, linking to customers.

Order_Items: A junction table linking orders to products and storing quantities.

Data Insertion: Populated the tables with sample data to simulate real-world transactions.

SQL Analysis: Wrote and executed a series of SQL queries to analyze the data, following the task hints.

Deliverables: Saved the analysis queries in the ecommerce_analysis.sql file and captured screenshots of the query outputs, as required.

SQL Queries Overview
The ecommerce_analysis.sql file contains queries that demonstrate the following concepts as required by the task:

Basic Filtering (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY): A query to find products above a certain price, ordered from highest to lowest.

Aggregates & Grouping (SUM, GROUP BY): A query to calculate the total revenue generated by each product.

Joins (LEFT JOIN): A query to list all customers and the total number of orders they have placed, including customers with zero orders.

Subqueries: A query to find the names of customers who purchased a specific product.

Views (CREATE VIEW): Created a view named v_OrderRevenue to simplify future queries for total revenue per order.

Optimization (CREATE INDEX): Added an index to the email column in the Customers table to speed up lookups.
